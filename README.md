# Machine Learning Team Project

## Overview

This project involves various machine learning techniques for classification tasks. Below is a brief description of each notebook and its purpose.

### Notebooks

1. **`pj_featureanalysis.ipynb`**: 
   - **Purpose**: Feature extraction and analysis.
   - **Description**: This notebook focuses on extracting and analyzing features from the dataset to better understand the data and prepare it for modeling.

2. **`pj_naivebayes.ipynb`**: 
   - **Purpose**: Classification of monitored data using categorical Naive Bayes.
   - **Description**: This notebook applies the Naive Bayes classification algorithm to categorical data to classify monitored data.

3. **`pj_randomforest.ipynb`**: 
   - **Purpose**: Classification of monitored data using Random Forest + finding thresholds for binary classification.
   - **Description**: This notebook uses the Random Forest algorithm for classification and also includes methods for determining thresholds in binary classification scenarios.

4. **`pj_decisiontree.ipynb`**: 
   - **Purpose**: Classification of monitored data using Decision Tree.
   - **Description**: This notebook employs the Decision Tree algorithm to classify monitored data.

5. **`pj_SVM.ipynb`**: 
   - **Purpose**: Classification of monitored data using Support Vector Machine (SVM).
   - **Description**: This notebook implements the SVM algorithm for the classification of monitored data.

6. **`pj_undon_data_predict_final.ipynb`**: 
   - **Purpose**: Classification of unmonitored data using Random Forest + Binary Classification and Multiclass Classification.
   - **Description**: This notebook is dedicated to the classification of unmonitored data using the Random Forest algorithm and includes both binary and multiclass classification methods.
